# Slice #4 schema — `approvals` + `automation_runs`

Implements the schema proposed in `/srv/ops-vault/proposals/approvals-schema-proposal.md` (§C narrowed by §M, owner-gated by §N).

**Status:** drafted 2026-05-12 (elron-lane, autonomous loop). All three slices (4a/4b/4c) shipped locally; awaiting owner-run `python apply.py` in production.

## Review provenance

- karpathy-critic round 1 (plan): CUT → split into 4a / 4b / 4c. Followed.
- Codex round 1 (proposal §M+N): REVISE → 6 changes incorporated into proposal.
- Codex round 2 (apply.py): REVISE → 4 changes incorporated:
  1. `chk_approval_executed` tightened to biconditional.
  2. `pg_constraint` guard scoped to `conrelid='approvals'::regclass` + `duplicate_object` swallow.
  3. New `chk_approval_idempotency_key_length` ≤120.
  4. Rollback delete-order child-first + cache-clear API call.

Codex budget exhausted for this slice (max 2 rounds/action per `codex-routing.md`). Next Codex round opens with the next migration.

## Shape contracts (slice 4a)

Each JSON file describes the **`approvals.proposed_payload`** shape per `action_type`. Validation lives in:

1. **Lane A UI** — before POST `/items/approvals`, validate against the matching contract. Reject early so the user sees the field-level error.
2. **Windmill** — before executing an approved approval, re-validate. Defense in depth; protects against drift between proposal and execution.

**Not** enforced in Postgres. Same reason cohorts/finance proposals avoid Postgres JSON Schema: Directus does not surface column-level JSON Schema, and validation belongs at the system boundary.

### Versioning

The `.v1.json` suffix is binding. To change a contract:

- **Backwards-compatible (additive optional field):** edit `.v1.json` in place.
- **Breaking (new required, type change, removed field):** copy to `.v2.json`. New rows write `_payload_schema_version: "v2"` in their `proposed_payload` and the consumer routes accordingly. Old rows continue to validate against `v1`.

## Owner-gated context

Per `/srv/ops-vault/proposals/approvals-schema-proposal.md §N`, owner approved the recommended defaults for N1–N8 (autonomous loop, 2026-05-12). Migration code does not run until owner executes `python apply.py` against production.

## Environment (target — for 4b)

```
DIRECTUS_URL            https://crm.merkazneshama.co.il
DIRECTUS_ADMIN_TOKEN    admin-grade static token
DB_CONTAINER            hycrm-directus-db
DB_USER                 hycrm
DB_NAME                 hycrm
```

(Same pattern as slice1-schema.)

## Run order (when ready — DO NOT RUN YET)

```bash
# Pre-flight (baseline; expect empty dump for fresh state)
sudo docker exec hycrm-directus-db pg_dump -U hycrm -d hycrm \
    -t approvals -t automation_runs \
    > /tmp/slice4-pre.dump

# 1. Apply — idempotent; safe to re-run. Does NOT mutate existing data.
DIRECTUS_URL=https://crm.merkazneshama.co.il \
DIRECTUS_ADMIN_TOKEN=<admin-token> \
python apply.py

# 2. Validate — WRITES test rows to verify CHECKs/state machine/FK RESTRICT.
#    Each row tagged with idempotency_key prefix 'test_slice4_<uuid>_*'.
#    Owner must run the cleanup SQL the script prints at the end.
DIRECTUS_URL=... DIRECTUS_ADMIN_TOKEN=... python validate.py

# 3. Rollback (only if apply/validate fails or owner reverts).
#    Interactive yes/NO prompt; requires exact "yes".
DIRECTUS_URL=... DIRECTUS_ADMIN_TOKEN=... bash rollback.sh
```

**validate.py is NOT read-only.** It POSTs ~3 approvals + 1 automation_runs and
PATCHes status transitions to exercise constraints. Test rows survive past the
script unless cleaned up; the script prints the exact `DELETE` SQL at the end.
